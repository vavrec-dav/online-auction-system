# Online Auction System

## Motivation:

I have always been curious to see if I’m capable of developing a microservice application — from scratch to production (including architecture, monitoring, Kubernetes deployment, etc.).
This project is my way of finding out whether I can do it, and it also serves as a reference project for future customers or employers.


## Architecture 

### System Context
This section describes the high-level context of the system, including external users (actors), external systems, and the main responsibilities of the application.

### Container Diagram
The container diagram provides a breakdown of the system into containers (applications or services), showing how they interact, communicate, and what technologies are used.
